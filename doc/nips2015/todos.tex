\begin{itemize}
  \item I don't like that "money" and "time" are explicit variables in the loss function, mainly because it seems too concrete for abstract math. We can choose an specific loss function at a later time dependent on those parameters. I might yet come around to this notation.
  \item The phrasing of the MRF problem, particular with respect to hypotheses, is a little clunky and would prefer reproducing the setup from standard literature.
  \item The handling of asynchrony is probably right, but I feel it can
    be tweaked a little bit.
  \item The actual algorithm sections need to be written out. An
    objective must be stated and optimized.
\end{itemize}
